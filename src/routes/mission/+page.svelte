    Cuatex’s mission is to democratize the internet's monetization, moderation
    and algorithms. We believe in this mission because of our core values of
    democracy, transparency, equity and optimism.

    At Cuatex we use a direct democracy approach, where each user has voting
    power to influence the direction of the platform. As a user you can vote on
    censorship, new features, Data Union decisions and more. We are always
    striving to have as much user input and responsibility as possible. We know
    that the average answer from a mass group of people will most likely be the
    best way forward. Lastly, we believe in a humanist approach to technology,
    which means that we create technology that is for people, not for
    organizations or AI.

    We are transparent as much as we can be, of course there are practical
    limitations to ensure our IP is protected, and when we IPO, we will have
    more restrictions. Nevertheless, we give complete access to the inner
    workings of Cuatex through our Feed Builder and Data Union program.
    Transparency is important to us because it keeps us responsible for our
    actions and it normalizes honesty. When we are transparent in our corporate,
    product and marketing decisions we tread carefully. If we never had this
    responsibility to be transparent, we could make decisions that are
    unethical. Cuatex has transparency baked into its product and corporate
    structure.

    Equity to us means being free of bias, seeing through multiple perspectives
    and everyone owns what they produce. Our freedom of bias is engineered,
    meaning that the product itself is incapable of having platform bias. With
    our Feed Builder and Data Union, we give complete control and
    decision-making power to you. Our platform is created to get the most out of
    every perspective and you actually own what you’ve created.

    We are optimistic. We believe in a good, caring future. And we are
    developing technology that is optimistic of the human need to think better
    and be responsible. We believe optimism is the best way to address the
    hardships of life while also creating a way to move forward.
